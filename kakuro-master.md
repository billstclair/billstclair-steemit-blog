# Kakuro Master

A bunch of things came together, causing me to stay up until 2am, writing the initial JavaScript for a new iOS and Android game, and web site.

1. I got hooked on [Kakuro](https://steemit.com/kakuro/@billstclair/kakuro).
2. @good-karma's work on [Steem Mobile](https://steemit.com/created/steemmobile) introduced me to the [Ionic app framework](http://ionicframework.com/), which enables easy creation of iOS and Android apps from a single HTML and JavaScript codebase.
3. As I was attempting to go to sleep, it occurred to me that generating a Kakuro board isn't really very hard.
4. I've done a number of other JavaScript projects, so I'm pretty good at it.

I bought the domain [Kakuro-Master.com](http://Kakuro-Master.com/), created a web site for it on my [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) machine, and wrote enough code to generate a board and display it in a table. I'm not done with that, but having gotten this far in a few hours of hacking, I'm motivated to keep going.

What I have written so far is live at [Kakuro-Master.com](http://Kakuro-Master.com/). All you can do with it at present is fill in a number from 2 to 9 (the maximum run length) and press the "Generate" button.

The code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/billstclair/kakuro-master).

Keep your eyes on the [kakuro-master](https://steemit.com/created/kakuro-master) tag for future reports.

Nice to have another personal project. Maybe I'll make some money with this one.
