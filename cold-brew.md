I've been making coffee with an [Aeropress](http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/), one cup at a time, for many years now. Recently I discovered, at Starbucks, cold brewed coffee. Instant love. So how to make it? Beginner's mind suggested the obvious solution, so I went to work.

I used my normal two scoops of beans per cup. I use [Capulin Coffee](http://capulin.com/). Jungle-grown in Mexico. Cleaned by hand. Never any water, until you add it.

I ground it up, added water and mixed well, covered with a saucer, and refrigerated overnight. Then did the usual Aeropress magic in the morning. Very easy. Very yummy!
