# Organizing My Steemit Source

I write Steemit posts in [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), using the [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [markdown-mode](http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/) to simplify entry of links and images. I keep them in a directory on my computer, which I mirror to my web site (with [rsyncit](https://steemit.com/hacking/@billstclair/rsyncit)). The files are named with a dash-separated sometimes-subset of their titles. If an article has images, they are stored in a directory of the same name. E.g. "kakuro.md" has a directory named "kakuro" for its image.

There's an index.html file in the directory containing a table of links to the articles, their source, and their photo directories.
